The next two sections do a nice job of covering file input and the notion of the "standard
error" with simple sample code.  But the authors are also making a subtle
point about UNIX and how the design of C makes it easy to build UNIX utilities.

By the end of section 7.6, we see a 29 line program that is a pretty much complete implementation
of the core functionality of the UNIX `cat` command.  Part of the philosophy of UNIX was to build
commands that are each simple building blocks that can be composed using standard input and output
redirection as well as pipes.

These next two sections are a gentle celebration of the design principles that underlie the UNIX operating
system.  Also, while we are talking about the linkage between C and UNIX, there is a UNIX-related
Easter Egg earlier in this chapter.  See if you can find it.  Bonus points if you already noticed it. :)
