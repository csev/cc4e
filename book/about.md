C Programming for Everybody (CC4E)
==================================

This course and web site is dedicated to learning
the "classic" version of
the C Programming language from the 1978 book written by
Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie.

This book places the reader in the middle
of the 1970's transition from a hardware-centered computer science
to a focus on writing portable and efficient software.  C was
used to develop operating systems like Unix, Minix, and Linux.

Programming languages like Python, Perl, Java, JavaScript, and
Ruby are all written in C.  Software like the early TCP/IP
networking implementations that made the Internet possible
were written in C.  And the first web browsers and web servers
were written in C.

Writing software in C enabled major advances in computer
architecture.  Operating systems, compilers, and
utilities could be re-compiled to work a new hardware platform
once we had a C compiler for the new hardware.

So much software has been written in C over the past 40 
years, that there is a very good chance that much of
the software that you each day use was either written
in C or written in a programming language that was written
in C.

So we study C less as a programming language to use
on a daily basis and more as the foundation of modern
software and computing.  In many ways, C is the
technology equivalent of the "Rosetta Stone" in that it
provides a connection between the programming languages
of past and the programming languages of the present.

The name "CC4E" in
[www.cc4e.com](www.cc4e.com)
refers to the original
UNIX command "CC" which was the command you used
to compile your C programs.  CC stood for "C Compiler"
and is featured on the first page of the first chapter
of the K&R C book.  Programmers like me from the 1970's
and 1980's typed `CC` on UNIX systems like
the AT&T 3B2 to compile and run their first "hello world"
program in C.

and computer architecture.

Welcome to the course.
